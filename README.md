# Cactus Website

## Purpose
The idea behind this project was to take a simple static website built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS,
and rebuild it using Blazor WebAssembly.

### Value I got from building this project
* Experience building simple razor components that use CSS and JS isolation.
* A deeper understanding and hands-on experience using Blazor's JS Interop.

### Disclaimer
This is not my design. The original design of the website belong to [Bedimcode](https://www.youtube.com/@Bedimcode)
